1. a) Download and Start Eclispe
   b) check that you have Apache Ant installed. On my Mac, ant 1.8.2
      is pre-installed.
   c) Install ragel - better to install it via homebrew
      brew install ragel

2. Create a workspace (Eclipse will require you do this when you start)

3. Install TestNG plugin - http://testng.org/doc/download.html
  Go to Help -> Install New Software -> Add 
  Click Add
  Enter Name -> TestNG, Location -> http://beust.com/eclipse
  Click Next
  Check TestNG and follow the instructions

4. Checkout ohcount4j project
  cd to your work dir
  git clone git@github.com:blackducksw/ohcount4j.git

5. Import this project in Eclipse
  Click File -> Import
  Choose General -> Existing Project into workspace
  Click Next
  Select root dir - <git-clone-dir>/ohcount4j
  In Projects: section, you should see ohlcount4j(<git-clone-dir>/ohcount4j) checked.
  Click Finish (do not check Copy Projects into workspace)

6. The project will show errors. This is due to the fact that Ragel generated java 
  files are missing. There is an ant build.xml file. It has a target gen-src for
  generating Java scanners in gen-src directory from Ragel definitions in scanners 
  directory.  

  amujumdar$ ant gen-src
  Buildfile: /Users/amujumdar/ohloh_github/ohcount4j/build.xml

  setup:
      [mkdir] Created dir: /Users/amujumdar/ohloh_github/ohcount4j/gen-src/net/ohloh/ohcount4j/scanner

      gen-src:

      BUILD SUCCESSFUL
      Total time: 0 seconds

7. Now if you refresh your project in Eclipse, compilation errors should go away.

About project Layout
  scanners - ragel scanner definitions. Because it produces Java, 
             name of the file should match scanner class name and it should have
             net.ohloh.ohcount4j.scanner package definition on top.
             Also, the extension should be .java.rl. See ExampleScanner.java.rl.
  src - source directory
  test - test source directory
  gen-src - generated scanner sources
            gen-src target invokes ragel command on each file in scanners directory
            and output goes into gen-src/net/ohloh/ohcount4j/scanner
  lib - libraries

8. You can also compile and package from command-line via
   ant compile or ant dist

9. To clean all generated files, run
   ant clean

10. Tests and test runs via ant - TBD
